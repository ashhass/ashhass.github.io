I am currently working on creating a YouTube series on the chronology of AI algorithms, hoping to understand how novel ideas are generated. I also work on 
independent research projects. 

I was previously a research assistant at KAUST working on concept based interpretability models. Before that, I spent sometime at the University of 
Michigan working on hand and held-object segmentation. I graduated from Addis Ababa University with a Bachelor's in Software Engineering.
