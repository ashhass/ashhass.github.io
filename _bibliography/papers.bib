abstract = "As humans, we learn a lot about how to interact with the world by observing others interacting with their hands. To help AI systems obtain a better understanding of hand interactions, we introduce a new model that produces a rich understanding of hand interaction. Our system produces a richer output than past systems at a larger scale. Our outputs include boxes and segments for hands, in-contact objects, and second objects touched by tools as well as contact and grasp type. Supporting this method are annotations of 257K images, 401K hands, 288K objects, and 19K second objects spanning four datasets. We show that our method provides rich information and performs and generalizes well.",
